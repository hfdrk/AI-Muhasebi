## 📋 Review Process Overview

This document provides a structured approach for the team to:
1. **Review** the recommendations
2. **Score** each feature based on multiple criteria
3. **Prioritize** features for implementation
4. **Plan** resource allocation
5. **Decide** on implementation timeline

---

## 🎯 Prioritization Framework

### Scoring Criteria (1-5 scale)

Each feature will be scored on:

1. **Business Value** (1-5)
   - 5 = Critical for competitive positioning
   - 4 = High value, significant impact
   - 3 = Medium value, good ROI
   - 2 = Low value, nice to have
   - 1 = Minimal value

2. **User Impact** (1-5)
   - 5 = Dramatically improves user experience
   - 4 = Significantly improves UX
   - 3 = Moderate UX improvement
   - 2 = Minor UX improvement
   - 1 = Negligible impact

3. **Implementation Effort** (1-5)
   - 1 = Quick win (1-2 weeks)
   - 2 = Low effort (2-4 weeks)
   - 3 = Medium effort (1-2 months)
   - 4 = High effort (2-3 months)
   - 5 = Very high effort (3+ months)

4. **Technical Risk** (1-5)
   - 1 = Low risk, well-understood
   - 2 = Low-medium risk
   - 3 = Medium risk
   - 4 = High risk, complex
   - 5 = Very high risk, uncertain

5. **Dependencies** (1-5)
   - 1 = No dependencies, can start immediately
   - 2 = Minor dependencies
   - 3 = Some dependencies
   - 4 = Significant dependencies
   - 5 = Blocked by other work

### Priority Score Calculation

**Priority Score = (Business Value × 2) + (User Impact × 2) + (100 / Implementation Effort) + (100 / Technical Risk) - Dependencies**

*Higher score = Higher priority*
